## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `serve()` and `serve_with_addr()` server startup helpers — reduces the ~25 lines
  of hyper boilerplate per agent to a single function call. Both `JsonRpcDispatcher`
  and `RestDispatcher` implement the new `Dispatcher` trait.
- `RetryPolicy` and `ClientBuilder::with_retry_policy()` — configurable automatic
  retry with exponential backoff for transient client errors (connection errors,
  timeouts, HTTP 429/502/503/504). Ships as a transparent `RetryTransport` wrapper.
- `ClientError::is_retryable()` — classifies errors as transient or permanent.
- `EventEmitter` upstreamed to `executor_helpers` module — reduces event emission
  from 7-line struct literals to one-liners (`emit.status(TaskState::Working).await?`).
  Previously lived only in the agent-team example.
- `CallContext::request_id` — first-class request/trace ID field, automatically
  populated from the `X-Request-ID` HTTP header when present.
- `Metrics::on_latency(method, duration)` callback — the #1 production metric.
  All handler methods now measure and report request latency.
- Blanket `impl Metrics for Arc<T>` — eliminates the `MetricsForward` wrapper
  pattern when sharing metrics across handlers.
- `CallContext::http_headers` field — interceptors can now inspect
  `Authorization`, `X-Request-Id`, and other HTTP headers for auth decisions.
- `HandlerLimits::push_delivery_timeout` — configurable per-webhook timeout
  (default 5s) prevents one slow webhook from blocking all subsequent deliveries.
- Background event processor for streaming mode — push notifications and task
  store updates now fire for every event regardless of consumer mode.
- `SqliteTaskStore` and `SqlitePushConfigStore` — persistent store reference
  implementations behind the `sqlite` feature flag, using `sqlx` for async
  SQLite access. Includes schema auto-creation, cursor-based pagination,
  and upsert support.
- `boxed_future` helper function and `agent_executor!` macro in
  `executor_helpers` module — reduces `AgentExecutor` boilerplate from
  5 lines to 1 line per method.
- Doc examples for `TaskStore` and `AgentExecutor` traits — `# Example`
  sections in rustdoc for crates.io users.
- Explicit `sqlite` feature gate in CI — clippy and test steps for the
  `sqlite` feature flag alongside existing feature-specific gates.
- `JsonRpcDispatcher` now serves agent cards at `GET /.well-known/agent.json`,
  matching the existing `RestDispatcher` behavior.
- `EventQueueManager::subscribe()` creates additional readers for an active
  task's event stream, enabling `SubscribeToTask` (resubscribe) when another
  SSE stream is already active.
- Agent-team example refactored from monolithic 2800-line `main.rs` into
  best-practice modular structure (18 files, all under 500 lines) with 50 E2E
  tests across 5 categories (basic, lifecycle, edge cases, stress, dogfood).
- Client `send_message()` and `stream_message()` now merge client-level config
  (`return_immediately`, `history_length`, `accepted_output_modes`) into
  request parameters automatically. Per-request values take precedence.
- Dogfooding documentation restructured into modular book sub-pages: bugs
  found, test coverage matrix, and open issues roadmap.
- `EventEmitter` helper in agent-team example — caches `task_id` +
  `context_id` from `RequestContext`, reducing 9-line event struct literals
  to 1-line calls. Proof-of-concept for upstream `executor_helpers` addition.
- 10 new dogfood regression tests (tests 41-50) covering agent card URL
  correctness, push config listing via JSON-RPC, event classification,
  resubscribe, multiple artifacts, concurrent streams, context filtering,
  file parts, and history length.
- `RateLimitInterceptor` and `RateLimitConfig` — built-in fixed-window
  per-caller rate limiting as a `ServerInterceptor`. Caller keys are derived
  from `CallContext::caller_identity`, `X-Forwarded-For`, or `"anonymous"`.
- `TaskStore::count()` method — returns the total number of stored tasks.
  Useful for metrics and capacity monitoring. Has a default implementation
  returning `0` for backward compatibility. Implemented for both
  `InMemoryTaskStore` and `SqliteTaskStore`.

### Improved

- `InMemoryQueueWriter::write()` no longer allocates a full `String` to
  measure serialized event size. Uses a zero-allocation `CountingWriter`
  that counts bytes via `serde_json::to_writer()` instead of `to_string()`.
- `InMemoryTaskStore::save()` no longer holds the write lock during O(n)
  eviction sweeps. Eviction is decoupled from the insert and runs in a
  separate lock acquisition, reducing write lock contention under high
  concurrency.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `PartContent` now uses `#[serde(tag = "type")]` with variant
  renames (`"text"`, `"file"`, `"data"`) per A2A spec. The old `Raw` and `Url`
  variants were merged into `File` with a new `FileContent` struct. Wire format
  now requires `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}` instead of `{"text": "..."}`.
  Backward-compatible `Part::raw()` and `Part::url()` constructors are provided.
- **Breaking:** `RequestHandler` stores changed from `Box<dyn TaskStore>` /
  `Box<dyn PushConfigStore>` / `Box<dyn PushSender>` to `Arc<dyn ...>` for
  cloneability into background tasks. `RequestHandlerBuilder` methods updated
  accordingly; `with_task_store_arc()` added for sharing store instances.
- **Breaking:** All `RequestHandler::on_*` methods now accept an additional
  `headers: Option<&HashMap<String, String>>` parameter for HTTP header
  forwarding to interceptors. Pass `None` if headers are not available.
- `handler.rs` (1,357 lines) split into 8 single-responsibility modules under
  `handler/`: `mod.rs`, `limits.rs`, `helpers.rs`, `messaging.rs`,
  `lifecycle.rs`, `push_config.rs`, `event_processing.rs`, `shutdown.rs`.
  No public API changes.
- **Breaking:** `EventQueueManager` internals redesigned from `mpsc` to
  `tokio::sync::broadcast` channels. This enables multiple concurrent
  subscribers per task. Slow readers receive `Lagged` notifications instead
  of blocking the writer. The public `EventQueueWriter` / `EventQueueReader`
  traits are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `SubscribeToTask` (resubscribe) now works when another SSE reader is already
  active for the same task. Previously, `mpsc` channels allowed only a single
  reader, so resubscription returned "no active event queue for task".
- `ClientBuilder::with_return_immediately(true)` now actually propagates to
  the server. Previously, the flag was stored in `ClientConfig` but never
  injected into `MessageSendParams.configuration`, so the server always
  waited for task completion.
- JSON-RPC `ListTaskPushNotificationConfigs` now correctly parses
  `ListPushConfigsParams` instead of `TaskIdParams`. The field name mismatch
  (`id` vs `task_id`) caused silent deserialization failure — push config
  listing via JSON-RPC was completely broken while REST worked.
- Agent-team example agent cards now contain correct URLs via pre-bind
  listener pattern. Previously, cards were built with `"http://placeholder"`
  before the server bound to a port.
- Agent-team webhook event classifier now checks correct field names
  (`statusUpdate`/`artifactUpdate` instead of `status`/`artifact`).

- URL percent-decoding for REST dispatcher path parameters.
- BOM (byte order mark) handling in JSON request bodies.
- Comprehensive hardening, dispatch, handler, push sender, and client test suites (600+ tests).
- `#[non_exhaustive]` on 6 protocol enums for forward-compatible evolution.
- SSRF protection for push notification webhook URLs (rejects private/loopback addresses).
- HTTP header injection prevention for push notification credentials.
- SSE parser memory limits (16 MiB default) to prevent OOM from malicious streams.
- Streaming task cancellation via `AbortHandle` on `Drop`.

- Cancellation token map size bounds with automatic stale token cleanup.
- Amortized task store eviction (every 64 writes instead of every write).
- `ClientError::Timeout` variant for distinct timeout errors.
- Separate `stream_connect_timeout` configuration for SSE connections.
- Server benchmarks for task store and event queue operations.
- Cargo-fuzz target for JSON deserialization of all major protocol types.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` documenting planned beyond-spec extensions (request IDs,
  metrics, rate limiting, WebSocket, multi-tenancy, persistent store).
- `LESSONS.md` pitfalls catalog with entries for serde, hyper, SSE, push
  notifications, async/tokio, workspace, and testing gotchas.

### Changed

- Eliminated unnecessary `serde_json::Value` clones in 8 client methods by
  moving the value into `ClientResponse` and extracting it after interceptors run.

- **Breaking:** `AgentExecutor` trait is now object-safe — methods return
  `Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = A2aResult<()>> + Send + 'a>>` instead of
  `impl Future`. This eliminates the generic parameter `E: AgentExecutor` from
  `RequestHandler`, `RequestHandlerBuilder`, `JsonRpcDispatcher`, and
  `RestDispatcher`, enabling dynamic dispatch via `Arc<dyn AgentExecutor>`.
- `InMemoryTaskStore` now performs TTL-based eviction of terminal tasks (default
  1 hour) and enforces a maximum capacity (default 10,000 tasks).

### Fixed

- Invalid state transitions (e.g. Submitted → Completed) are now rejected with `InvalidStateTransition` error.
- Push notification delivery now properly times out instead of hanging indefinitely.

### Removed

- (Nothing removed — this is the initial release.)
