# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Metrics::on_latency(method, duration)` callback — the #1 production metric.
  All handler methods now measure and report request latency.
- Blanket `impl Metrics for Arc<T>` — eliminates the `MetricsForward` wrapper
  pattern when sharing metrics across handlers.
- `CallContext::http_headers` field — interceptors can now inspect
  `Authorization`, `X-Request-Id`, and other HTTP headers for auth decisions.
- `HandlerLimits::push_delivery_timeout` — configurable per-webhook timeout
  (default 5s) prevents one slow webhook from blocking all subsequent deliveries.
- Background event processor for streaming mode — push notifications and task
  store updates now fire for every event regardless of consumer mode.
- `JsonRpcDispatcher` now serves agent cards at `GET /.well-known/agent.json`,
  matching the existing `RestDispatcher` behavior.
- `EventQueueManager::subscribe()` creates additional readers for an active
  task's event stream, enabling `SubscribeToTask` (resubscribe) when another
  SSE stream is already active.
- Agent-team example refactored from monolithic 2800-line `main.rs` into
  best-practice modular structure (17 files, all under 500 lines) with 40 E2E
  tests across 4 categories (basic, lifecycle, edge cases, stress).
- Client `send_message()` and `stream_message()` now merge client-level config
  (`return_immediately`, `history_length`, `accepted_output_modes`) into
  request parameters automatically. Per-request values take precedence.
- Dogfooding documentation restructured into modular book sub-pages: bugs
  found, test coverage matrix, and open issues roadmap.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `PartContent` now uses `#[serde(tag = "type")]` with variant
  renames (`"text"`, `"file"`, `"data"`) per A2A spec. The old `Raw` and `Url`
  variants were merged into `File` with a new `FileContent` struct. Wire format
  now requires `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}` instead of `{"text": "..."}`.
  Backward-compatible `Part::raw()` and `Part::url()` constructors are provided.
- **Breaking:** `RequestHandler` stores changed from `Box<dyn TaskStore>` /
  `Box<dyn PushConfigStore>` / `Box<dyn PushSender>` to `Arc<dyn ...>` for
  cloneability into background tasks. `RequestHandlerBuilder` methods updated
  accordingly; `with_task_store_arc()` added for sharing store instances.
- **Breaking:** All `RequestHandler::on_*` methods now accept an additional
  `headers: Option<&HashMap<String, String>>` parameter for HTTP header
  forwarding to interceptors. Pass `None` if headers are not available.
- `handler.rs` (1,357 lines) split into 8 single-responsibility modules under
  `handler/`: `mod.rs`, `limits.rs`, `helpers.rs`, `messaging.rs`,
  `lifecycle.rs`, `push_config.rs`, `event_processing.rs`, `shutdown.rs`.
  No public API changes.
- **Breaking:** `EventQueueManager` internals redesigned from `mpsc` to
  `tokio::sync::broadcast` channels. This enables multiple concurrent
  subscribers per task. Slow readers receive `Lagged` notifications instead
  of blocking the writer. The public `EventQueueWriter` / `EventQueueReader`
  traits are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `SubscribeToTask` (resubscribe) now works when another SSE reader is already
  active for the same task. Previously, `mpsc` channels allowed only a single
  reader, so resubscription returned "no active event queue for task".
- `ClientBuilder::with_return_immediately(true)` now actually propagates to
  the server. Previously, the flag was stored in `ClientConfig` but never
  injected into `MessageSendParams.configuration`, so the server always
  waited for task completion.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Initial implementation of the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) v1.0.0 protocol specification.
- Core protocol type definitions and serialization.
- HTTP server with streaming (SSE) and JSON-RPC 2.0 dual transport.
- Client library for interacting with A2A-compatible agents.
- `SECURITY.md` with coordinated disclosure policy.
- `GOVERNANCE.md` with project governance and contribution guidelines.
- Health check endpoints (`GET /health`, `GET /ready`) for liveness/readiness probes.
- Request body size limits (4 MiB) to prevent DoS via oversized payloads.
- Content-Type validation on both JSON-RPC and REST dispatchers.
- Path traversal protection on the REST dispatcher.
- `TaskStoreConfig` with configurable TTL and capacity for `InMemoryTaskStore`.
- `RequestHandlerBuilder::with_task_store_config()` for store configuration.
- `ServerError::PayloadTooLarge` variant for body size limit violations.
- Executor timeout support via `RequestHandlerBuilder::with_executor_timeout()` to kill hung executors.
- Per-request HTTP timeout for `HttpPushSender` (default 30s) via `HttpPushSender::with_timeout()`.
- `TaskState::can_transition_to()` for handler-level state machine validation.
- Cursor-based pagination for `ListTasks` via `TaskStoreConfig`.
- URL percent-decoding for REST dispatcher path parameters.
- BOM (byte order mark) handling in JSON request bodies.
- Comprehensive hardening, dispatch, handler, push sender, and client test suites (600+ tests).
- `#[non_exhaustive]` on 6 protocol enums for forward-compatible evolution.
- SSRF protection for push notification webhook URLs (rejects private/loopback addresses).
- HTTP header injection prevention for push notification credentials.
- SSE parser memory limits (16 MiB default) to prevent OOM from malicious streams.
- Streaming task cancellation via `AbortHandle` on `Drop`.
- CORS support via `CorsConfig` for browser-based A2A clients.
- Graceful shutdown via `RequestHandler::shutdown()`.
- Path traversal protection against percent-encoded bypass (`%2E%2E`).
- Query string length limits (4 KiB) for DoS protection.
- Cancellation token map size bounds with automatic stale token cleanup.
- Amortized task store eviction (every 64 writes instead of every write).
- `ClientError::Timeout` variant for distinct timeout errors.
- Separate `stream_connect_timeout` configuration for SSE connections.
- Server benchmarks for task store and event queue operations.
- Cargo-fuzz target for JSON deserialization of all major protocol types.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` documenting planned beyond-spec extensions (request IDs,
  metrics, rate limiting, WebSocket, multi-tenancy, persistent store).
- `LESSONS.md` pitfalls catalog with entries for serde, hyper, SSE, push
  notifications, async/tokio, workspace, and testing gotchas.

### Changed

- Eliminated unnecessary `serde_json::Value` clones in 8 client methods by
  moving the value into `ClientResponse` and extracting it after interceptors run.

- **Breaking:** `AgentExecutor` trait is now object-safe — methods return
  `Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = A2aResult<()>> + Send + 'a>>` instead of
  `impl Future`. This eliminates the generic parameter `E: AgentExecutor` from
  `RequestHandler`, `RequestHandlerBuilder`, `JsonRpcDispatcher`, and
  `RestDispatcher`, enabling dynamic dispatch via `Arc<dyn AgentExecutor>`.
- `InMemoryTaskStore` now performs TTL-based eviction of terminal tasks (default
  1 hour) and enforces a maximum capacity (default 10,000 tasks).

### Fixed

- Invalid state transitions (e.g. Submitted → Completed) are now rejected with `InvalidStateTransition` error.
- Push notification delivery now properly times out instead of hanging indefinitely.

### Removed

- (Nothing removed — this is the initial release.)
