## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial implementation of the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) v1.0.0 protocol specification.
- Core protocol type definitions and serialization.
- HTTP server with streaming (SSE) and JSON-RPC 2.0 dual transport.
- Client library for interacting with A2A-compatible agents.
- `SECURITY.md` with coordinated disclosure policy.
- `GOVERNANCE.md` with project governance and contribution guidelines.
- Health check endpoints (`GET /health`, `GET /ready`) for liveness/readiness probes.
- Request body size limits (4 MiB) to prevent DoS via oversized payloads.
- Content-Type validation on both JSON-RPC and REST dispatchers.
- Path traversal protection on the REST dispatcher.
- `TaskStoreConfig` with configurable TTL and capacity for `InMemoryTaskStore`.
- `RequestHandlerBuilder::with_task_store_config()` for store configuration.
- `ServerError::PayloadTooLarge` variant for body size limit violations.
- Executor timeout support via `RequestHandlerBuilder::with_executor_timeout()` to kill hung executors.
- Per-request HTTP timeout for `HttpPushSender` (default 30s) via `HttpPushSender::with_timeout()`.
- `TaskState::can_transition_to()` for handler-level state machine validation.
- Cursor-based pagination for `ListTasks` via `TaskStoreConfig`.
- URL percent-decoding for REST dispatcher path parameters.
- BOM (byte order mark) handling in JSON request bodies.
- Comprehensive hardening, dispatch, handler, push sender, and client test suites (500+ tests).
- `#[non_exhaustive]` on 6 protocol enums for forward-compatible evolution.
- SSRF protection for push notification webhook URLs (rejects private/loopback addresses).
- HTTP header injection prevention for push notification credentials.
- SSE parser memory limits (16 MiB default) to prevent OOM from malicious streams.
- Streaming task cancellation via `AbortHandle` on `Drop`.
- CORS support via `CorsConfig` for browser-based A2A clients.
- Graceful shutdown via `RequestHandler::shutdown()`.
- Path traversal protection against percent-encoded bypass (`%2E%2E`).
- Query string length limits (4 KiB) for DoS protection.
- Cancellation token map size bounds with automatic stale token cleanup.
- Amortized task store eviction (every 64 writes instead of every write).
- `ClientError::Timeout` variant for distinct timeout errors.
- Separate `stream_connect_timeout` configuration for SSE connections.
- Server benchmarks for task store and event queue operations.
- Cargo-fuzz target for JSON deserialization of all major protocol types.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` documenting planned beyond-spec extensions (request IDs,
  metrics, rate limiting, WebSocket, multi-tenancy, persistent store).
- `LESSONS.md` pitfalls catalog with entries for serde, hyper, SSE, push
  notifications, async/tokio, workspace, and testing gotchas.

### Changed

- Eliminated unnecessary `serde_json::Value` clones in 8 client methods by
  moving the value into `ClientResponse` and extracting it after interceptors run.

- **Breaking:** `AgentExecutor` trait is now object-safe — methods return
  `Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = A2aResult<()>> + Send + 'a>>` instead of
  `impl Future`. This eliminates the generic parameter `E: AgentExecutor` from
  `RequestHandler`, `RequestHandlerBuilder`, `JsonRpcDispatcher`, and
  `RestDispatcher`, enabling dynamic dispatch via `Arc<dyn AgentExecutor>`.
- `InMemoryTaskStore` now performs TTL-based eviction of terminal tasks (default
  1 hour) and enforces a maximum capacity (default 10,000 tasks).

### Fixed

- Invalid state transitions (e.g. Submitted → Completed) are now rejected with `InvalidStateTransition` error.
- Push notification delivery now properly times out instead of hanging indefinitely.

### Removed

- (Nothing removed — this is the initial release.)
