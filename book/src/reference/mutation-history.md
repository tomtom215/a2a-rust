# Mutation Testing History

A dated record of full-workspace mutation sweep results, so the
surviving-mutant count has a durable history rather than only living in
GitHub Actions artifacts (retained 90 days — see
[CI/CD](./../deployment/cicd.md#mutation-testing-workflow)) or transient CI
logs.

## Why this page exists

`mutants.yml` runs a full sweep weekly and fails the workflow on any
surviving mutant, but a failing scheduled workflow is a notification, not a
record: it says *this week* had a survivor, not *when the score last
changed* or *what the trend looks like*. Nothing before this page captured
that — a real gap this project should not let recur, in the same spirit as
`docs/official-tck-findings.md`'s conformance history.

## How to add an entry

After a full sweep completes (`mutants-summary` job in `mutants.yml`), copy
the aggregated table from that run's `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` output into a new
row below, dated to the run, with the commit it ran against. A clean sweep
(zero missed) is still worth recording — "still zero" is signal too, not a
no-op.

## History

| Date | Commit | Overall Score | Caught | Missed | Timeout | Notes |
|------|--------|---------------|-------:|-------:|--------:|-------|
| _(none recorded yet)_ | | | | | | This ledger was created 2026-07-30, retroactively, before any full sweep's result had been captured into it. The next scheduled Monday sweep (or an on-demand `workflow_dispatch` run) is the first opportunity to populate a real row — do not backfill a number that wasn't actually measured. |
